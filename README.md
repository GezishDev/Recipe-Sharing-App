🧰 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or later)

npm or yarn

A Firebase account (for backend services)

Installation
Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/Gezish-Webs/Recipe-Sharing-App.git
cd Recipe-Sharing-App
Install dependencies

bash
npm install
Set up Firebase

Create a new Firebase project at firebase.google.com.

Enable Authentication with Email/Password.

Create a Firestore Database (start in test mode).

Enable Storage (start in test mode).

Register a web app to get your Firebase config.

Environment variables

Copy the .env.example file to .env:

bash
cp .env.example .env

bash
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in the browser.

🏗️ Building for Production
To create a production build:

bash
npm run build
The output will be in the dist folder, ready to be deployed to any static hosting service.

🌐 Deployment
This project is configured for easy deployment on Vercel.

Push your code to a GitHub repository.

Import the project on Vercel.

Add the environment variables (same as in .env).

Vercel will automatically detect Vite and apply the correct build settings.

Your app will be live at a *.vercel.app URL.

Note for client‑side routing:
The repository includes a vercel.json file (or you can use a _redirects file in the public folder) to ensure all routes are rewritten to index.html. This prevents 404 errors on direct page reloads.
